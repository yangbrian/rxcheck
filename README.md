# RXCheck
RxCheck allows patients to input their medication and existing conditions, cross checking for potential prescription violations within our database.

Further, RxCheck offers the option for a user to input their email address and phone number, and if any potential new information or recalls are made available, RxCheck will notify the patient immediately.
